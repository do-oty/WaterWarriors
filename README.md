# Geology Wiki Website - Proof of Concept (WATER WARRRIORS PROJECT)

## Overview
This proof of concept website is designed to serve as a collaborative, user-driven wiki focused on geology. It aims to provide a comprehensive platform for learning, sharing, and contributing knowledge on various geology-related topics, from rock formations to tectonic processes. The site will allow users to explore articles, add content, edit existing entries, and engage with the community in discussions about Earth's structure, materials, and dynamic systems.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Articles**: Users can create, edit, and update geology-related articles, ensuring the content remains current and accurate.
- **Categorized Content**: Topics are organized into different categories, such as Mineralogy, Petrology, Paleontology, and Plate Tectonics, for easy navigation.
- **Search Functionality**: A powerful search tool to quickly find articles based on keywords or specific topics.
- **Community Contributions**: Registered users can submit new articles, suggest edits to existing ones, or flag content for review by moderators.
- **Interactive Maps**: Users can explore interactive maps showcasing different geological features, formations, and fault lines across the world.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Articles may include images, videos, and diagrams to provide a visual understanding of geological phenomena.
- **User Discussions**: Each article features a discussion section where users can ask questions, discuss theories, or share related information.
- **Reference Section**: Articles include a reference section to ensure that data and information are sourced from credible academic and scientific publications.

## Goals

- To create a community-driven platform where geology enthusiasts and professionals can collaborate to build a free and open resource on all things geology.
- To provide detailed, peer-reviewed information for students, educators, and researchers interested in geology.
- To foster discussions around cutting-edge geological research and the latest discoveries.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Vue.js for interactive elements)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing articles, user data, and metadata)
